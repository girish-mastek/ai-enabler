    "usecase": "Use case: To create a utility tool which sorts the permision-set.xml\n\nBackground - During Salesforce deployments, especially with permission sets, we frequently encounter significant differences in XML files due to formatting or the placement of elements. These differences, while not affecting functionality, result in unnecessary noise during file comparisons and can make it difficult to pinpoint actual changes. This is particularly problematic for permission set XMLs, which can often exceed 5,000 - 10,000 lines in length.\n\nChallenges: Existing out-of-the-box sorting functionalities, as well as third-party VS Code extensions, have been tested. Unfortunately, none of these solutions are tailored specifically for Salesforce permission sets, leaving teams to handle comparing the elements manually. This manual process is time-consuming and error-prone, especially during commits.\n\nTo address this, developing a custom utility designed to automatically sort XML elements within Salesforce permission sets before they are compared. By sorting the XML files uniformly, the utility will remove non-functional differences caused by formatting or element order, allowing teams to focus on identifying and resolving actual discrepancies.\n\nPrompts Used:\nhttps://chatgpt.com/share/670f6da0-6670-800d-a1d6-913757b5680a\nhttps://chatgpt.com/share/670f6dce-b4d4-800d-a0bd-cdf2b7cb45da\n\nResults: Implementated an execuatable jar file, where we can input an xml, sort then save before comparison.",
